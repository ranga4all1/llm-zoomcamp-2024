They might be able to give you permission or offer advice on catching up with the class.\\n\\n3. **Speak with Academic Advising:** Academic advisors can provide information specific to your situation and may facilitate late enrollment if it is an option.\\n\\n4. **Self-Assessment:** Consider whether you'll be able to handle catching up on missed coursework. Some courses might be harder to join late than others, depending on their structure and content.\\n\\n5. **Administrative Offices:** Contact the registrar or the administrative office responsible for enrollments. They will have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding deadlines and procedures.\\n\\n6. **Online Courses:** If the course is online or has flexible start dates, there's a higher possibility that late enrollment will be allowed.\\n\\nBy taking these steps, you can determine whether it’s possible to enroll late and what you need to do to catch up with the coursework.\""

Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:\\n   ```sh\\n   python -m venv env\\n   source env/bin/activate\\n   pip install -r ../requirements.txt\\n   ```\\n   For Windows, use:\\n   ```sh\\n   env\\\\Scripts\\\\activate\\n   ```\\n3.

When done, you can deactivate it with:\\n   ```sh\\n   deactivate\\n   ```\\n5.
